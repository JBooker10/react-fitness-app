<strong>A Fitness App</strong>

I created a fitness app using React, Firebase, and Bootstrap 4 to mainly track and log the progression of each of my workouts. and to understand which 
muscle(s) is being targeted when doing an exercise routine. The application is incorporated using a firebase API I built to dispatch exercises along with 
their descriptions. This is mainly for the purpose of quickly searching the proper techniques used for each activity with in the app. 

The API is link to 
an SVG node resembling the anatomy of the human body  which encompasses over 320 children nodes --each representing a particular muscle or muscle group 
that comprises the anatonomical structure. When a user clicks or response to an exercise each muscle mutates its color to highlight which muscles are 
being targeted. The application stores my information in the database and logs the workout. The app, using D3.js, displays an interactive bar chart to 
show the max-weight achieved for each workout.
